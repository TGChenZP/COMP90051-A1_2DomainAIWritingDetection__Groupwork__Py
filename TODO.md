Two different domains
-classify into two different domains, and then build two models to predict
-add a feature to it?

Feature Balancing (at least 3 differnet methods)
-SMOTE?
-Upsample/Downsample
-RESEARCH

MODELLING PATH
Deep Learning vs Machine Learning
-Deep Learning  
    -Embedding (2 paths)
        -self pre-train W2V?
        -#RESEARCH pre-train W2V
        -pytorch embedding...

    -Model 
        -LSTM
        -Transformers (BERT)
        -Pretrained models with embedding swapped out?
            -RoBERTA + other huggingface #RESEARCH


-Typical Machine Learning
    Feature engineering (2 paths)
        -TFIDF
        -BOW
        -#RESEARCH
    -feature selection 
        -Ron's method
        -anyone else have any methods?
    -Normalisation? (2 paths)
    -everything on sklearn + xgboost + catboost + lgbm + explianableboost + MLP + Transformer ~= 21 models 

-大模型？
    -#RESEARCH
